# Arduino Motor Control

Two motors were wired and programmed to an Arduino Uno using a motor controller, connected to a 9V battery source and 5V Arduino power (refer to Figure 1). A potentiometer was also used to control the motors speed with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) pins in the arduino. In addition to that, a dip switch was used to switch between different control modes. This task was done using the web app, Tinkercad.

The Arduino was programmed to accomplish the following tasks:
  <ul>
  <li>Make both motors move forward and backward</li>
  <li>Make left motor move backwards and right motor move forwards</li>
  <li>Make all motors stop</li>
  </ul>
