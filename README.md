###### Two motors were wired and programmed to an Arduino Uno using a motor controller, connected to a 9V battery source and 5V Arduino power (refer to Figure 1). A potentiometer was also used to control the motors speed with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) pins in the arduino. In addition to that, a dip switch was used to switch between different control modes. This task was done using the web app, Tinkercad.
